### Digital-SoC-design-2
**Introduction to QFN-48 package,chip,pads,core,die and IPs**


Let us look in this picture-

We all know what it is - A Arduino board. But do we know how to make this?  
The process to make this is just like this-

But we are not here for arduino making or SoC design, we are here for chip design! So were are only going to learn(and look inside) about the bottom left corner of the Arduino.
Those just look like these (Rough implementation of that)-

This is a QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-leads). Through learning, we will learn that it is called as a package ,not a chip


This is not just the end of it, there are many parts to it too! Just like this-

These wires are used to connect the chip to their respective pins. They are known as wire bonds.


<ins>Wire bonds</ins> - Wire bonding is a process that creates electrical connections between semiconductor chips and their packages or other chips.


There are also some other parts of a package. The're shown in the given image-

<ins>Pads</ins> - In chip design, "pads" refer to the metallic areas located on the edges of a semiconductor die.

<ins>Die</ins> - In chip design, a die is a small piece of semiconducting material that contains a functional circuit.

<ins>Core</ins>  - In chip design, a core is a self-contained processing unit that can perform computations and execute instructions independently.

So as, we have learnt about those we will look how a sample SoC or a sample chip looks like-

<ins>Foundry IPs</ins> - Foundry IPs are reusable design modules that are used in chip design and manufactured by foundries.
